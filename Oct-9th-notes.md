Tonight we had a very successful networking and learning session at the Cola Town Bike Collective donor thank you event:

- Scott is very much on board, as are the 4 other people I spoke to who are current or ex- CTBC board members ü•≥

- I got several people to scan my QR code to visit the website and a few of them signed up for the mailing list, so we have our first few contacts saved in givebutter

- I picked Scott's brain about a bunch of things including fundraising, advertising, grants, bike suppliers, bike styles/features; I can probably relay better verbally but in general....

1) For bikes: AliExpress shipping container loads by the hundreds are cheap (eg only $50 per decent enough bike üò≥) but shipping and logistics is expensive, slow and unpredictable. Avoid, for our use case. 

2) A couple of local South Carolina brands of import+assembler bikes he used to recommend and still has some leftover bikes in stock from, sadly went bust a couple years ago. 

3) He actually did, very unexpectedly for me, recommend some of the Walmart Ozark Trail bikes, apparently one of the family members is really into bikes and has actually put some thought into their latest range. They're still assembled like shit so any we bought would need to be put through a full teardown/maintenance session at the bike co-op before giving to a kid, but he'd do that for $100 so if we buy one of the Walmart bikes which is at or under $350, we should still have enough to include the initial safety maintenance plus helmet etc in the $500/kid budget üòç this model would mean we would be able to pay Scott to service a batch of like 10 at a time and he'd enjoy that cos doing the same maintenance task on multiple units of the exact same bike is pretty easy and time efficient.

4) We might need to worry about / be really careful about our positioning of the org when it comes to liability/catastrophic insurance for the kids who ride. Realistically we need to avoid the situation where the helmet heads org itself comes into scope for that liability, at it would be prohibitively expensive for us (eg think $10k annually per kid enrolled...). So will need to be okayed by the school board to be covered by the school's insurance, or covered by some other affiliated org. He gave an example of a similar org in upstate SC (didn't know the name) who managed to get the kids covered by the university sports team (I think) insurance.

A couple of people including Scott suggested I should talk to Reagan about it lol üòÖ generally everyone was supportive. I'll probably DM Reagan on Instagram and ask him to check out the website.

I even asked directly about whether I'd be stepping on toes or risking any ill will by dipping into the same donor pool, he said absolutely not an issue, it's true for several of the other bike orgs anyway when it comes to Midlands giving time and other grant competition etc - we agreed that ultimately we're all working towards the same bike friendly cities future, so there's no bad blood ‚ù§Ô∏è

Next steps: we should look at the Walmart bikes and make a shortlist of ones which look reasonable in our price range, and send Scott the list to review. He'll give us some feedback with his nerdy bike parts knowledge and recommend a specific unit to buy. We can then buy 10 of those with initial donations, give them to CTBC to make safe, and get the ball rolling in prepping paperwork and processes etc.!
