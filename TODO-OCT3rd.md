Notes captured from transcript to inform tasks:
- First ride concept: leave campus, short destination (e.g., Piecewise coffee shop), return; treat as “tryout.” Requires school approval and parent info.
- Price point: $500–$600 per bike is reasonable; avoid ultra‑cheap bikes; plan size mix and handle stock limitations.
- Messaging: avoid committing to weekly cadence publicly; say “regular group rides.”
- Bike trains explanation should highlight community, safety, and truancy benefit.
- Consider Teams/leaderboard on Givebutter to engage students/fundraisers.
